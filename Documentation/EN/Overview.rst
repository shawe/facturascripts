Guidelines

1. Facturascripts uses PSR-1 and PSR-2.

2. Facturascripts is designed to use the least possible dependencies and simplicity.
This means that not all feature requests will be accepted.

3. Facturascripts has a minimum PHP version requirement of 7.0. PR applications must respect
this requirement. Integration with other PHP version requirements will be denied.

4. All PR requests must include unit tests to ensure that the change works as
expected and to avoid regressions.

Any questions, questions or errors you may find you can comment in the chat: https://facturascripts.slack.com
or create the corresponding topic at https://github.com/NeoRazorX/facturascripts/issues


Pull Requests
-------------

All contributions are well received in FacturaScripts, but please read the following before:

Content
    Check that your code complies with the standards `PSR-1 <http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1>`__ and `PSR-2 <http://www.php-fig.org/ psr / psr-2>`__.

Documentation
    Documentation is something that is essential for everyone to better understand how to use
    the code made by others, or even to understand what we did ourselves some time ago.


Writing a Pull Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Title
    Ideally, a Pull Request should refer to only one objective, so independent changes can be combined quickly.
    If you want, for example, to correct a typographical error and improve the performance of a process, you should try as much as possible to do it
    in separate PR, so we can incorporate one quickly while the other one can be discussed.
    The objective is to obtain a clean change record and make a reversal easy.
    If you have found a typo / bug when writing your changes that are not related to your work, please do another
    Pull Request for it. In some rare cases, you will be forced to do it in the same PR. In these types of situations,
    please add a comment in your PR explaining why it should be like this.

Change Log
    For each PR, a change log must be provided.
    In the notes you can use the following sections:

    #. ``Added`` for new features.
    #. ``Changed`` to indicate changes in existing functionalities.
    #. ``Obsolete`` for features that have become obsolete and will be eliminated.
    #. ``Removed`` for obsolete features that have been removed.
    #. ``Fixed`` for any error correction.
    #. ``Security`` to invite users to update in case of vulnerabilities.

    This makes it easy for any user
